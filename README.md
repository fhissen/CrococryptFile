* Password-based encryption (following PBKDF2) with Serpent-256
* Password-based encryption (following PBKDF2) with Camellia-256
* Windows Keystore based encryption using RSA keys and AES-256
* GPG/OpenPGP key based encryption with AES-256
* Cloaked (headerless) Password based Encryption (AES-Twofish-256)
* Cloaked (headerless) Password based Encryption (AES-Twofish-256) padded to multiples of 1MB but also allows for arbitrary size

We have written a short article to describe [how cloaked files](https://www.hissenit.com/introducing-cloaked-headerless-files-crococryptfile-13-released-frank-hissen-it-blog.html "Introducing cloaked (headerless) files") work.
